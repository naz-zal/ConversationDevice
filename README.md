# ConversationDevice

The conversation device can be used in tandom with the NPC device to create narrative-driven experiences in Fortnite. 

To make use of this code, you'll need:

1. A conversation device with two choices that trigger two events (events 1 and 2)
2. An NPC device that has custom verse behaviour
3. Two lock devices
4. A button device that, when interacted with, initiates the conversation device
